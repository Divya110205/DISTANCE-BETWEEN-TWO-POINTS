# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
Use the function and we will start the program
### Step 2: 
We will take list of the values
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
End the program

### PROGRAM:
  
### OUTPUT:
![Exp 1c](https://github.com/Divya110205/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/assets/119404855/11efa44f-9154-435c-820e-43f5220abd00)

### RESULT:
Thus the distance of the two variables matrix is successfully solved using python program
